<h2>Welcome to SN2023c(ádiz)m(eeting)! </h2>

This year we hold a meeting in Cádiz (Spain) with the goal to reunite scientists collaborators from multiple research centers.  We aim to explore our current work on supernovae and their host galaxies and to encourage the exchange of knowledge and new ideas between the participants.
