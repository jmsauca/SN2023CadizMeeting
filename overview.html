<p>Welcome to Supernovae in Cádiz 2023 workshop!
This year we hold a workshop in Cádiz (Spain) with the goal to reunite scientists
collaborators from multiple research centers. We aim to explore our current work on
supernovae and their envoirenments. The encounter will encourage the exchange of
knowledge and new ideas between the participants. This workshop is co-financed by
the European Union under the 2014-2020 ERDF Operational Programme and by the
Department of Economic Transformation, Industry, Knowledge, and Universities of the
Regional Government of Andalusia. Project reference : FEDER-UCA18-107404.</p>
